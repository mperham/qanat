 - Move away from git-based distribution and instead modify Qanat to be a Rubygem along with a generator and binary, a la Rails.
 - Better service / process management support.  Sample recipes for monit and god monitoring.  Sample init.d shell script.
 - Support for other MQ servers: RabbitMQ (via http://github.com/mperham/bunny), others?
 - Test suite (tough since Qanat requires EM)
